# PlayerStats

● Designed and sought out soccer team player's stat tracker, honing skills in object-oriented design and Java software design
  principles. Code was structured with inheritance and interfaces used within class creation.
  
● Implemented intuitive user interface for team managers to input player details, positions, and jersey numbers as
  various factors to display on dynamic bar graphs integrated using JavaFX. Information stored in an organized manner
  allowed regular access for updating player statistics throughout the full course of a season.
